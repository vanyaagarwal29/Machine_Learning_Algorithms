Through experience and practice, they gradually develop an understanding of how to maintain balance, pedal, steer, and control speed. Initially, there may be some trial and error, but with repeated attempts, the learner improves their coordination and gradually becomes more proficient in riding the bicycle.\n",

Individuals typically start with little or no knowledge of the language and gradually progress through various stages of learning, such as memorizing words and phrases, practicing speaking and writing, and gaining exposure to the language through reading or listening. Over time, with consistent practice and exposure, learners become more fluent and proficient in understanding, speaking, and writing in the new language.\n",

By optimizing its actions based on the feedback, the agent aims to learn an optimal policy for decision-making.
